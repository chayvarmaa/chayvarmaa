### About

I build data pipelines, train and deploy machine learning models, and ship
production-ready systems. My background is in Industrial Engineering with a
strong focus on software — every project in this portfolio was built from
scratch to develop a specific engineering skill.

Currently on F-1 OPT status. Visa sponsorship required.
